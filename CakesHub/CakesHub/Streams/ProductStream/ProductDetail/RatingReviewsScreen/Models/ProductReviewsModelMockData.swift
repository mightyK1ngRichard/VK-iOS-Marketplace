    The dress is great! Very classy and comfortable. It fit perfectly! I'm 5'7" and 130 pounds. I am a 34B chest. This dress would be too long for those who are shorter but could be hemmed. I wouldn't recommend it for those big chested as I am smaller chested and it fit me perfectly. The underarms were not too wide and the dress was made well.
